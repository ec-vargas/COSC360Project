We have included our site map showing interactivity between pages, 
an example home page in html, a style.css sheet we plan to use to style our finalized website
and a document showing our web wireframes and the logic processes users will use to interact with them. 
CLient-side validation is included both in the wireframes and our write-up about logic processes.
